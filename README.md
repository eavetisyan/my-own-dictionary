# my-own-dictionary
Well, I'm try to improve my English vocabulary. I thought that it's need to have an application which can make and supplement my own dictionary only with words that I've never seen before. In addition it should be able to produce vocabulary testing.
So, this repository is my try to implement this idea. It will be interesting, stay tune :)
